## Metaverse
Metaverse is a web application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, providing a seamless and visually appealing user experience. Below, you'll find detailed information about the project, its features, technologies used, and instructions for running the application locally or contributing to its development.

##Technologies Used
Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies building modern and responsive web designs.
Framer Motion: Framer Motion is a motion library for React that allows for smooth animations and transitions.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
